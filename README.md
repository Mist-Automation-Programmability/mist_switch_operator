## Features
- list switches
- single/multi ports configuration changes
- update switch settings


## How it's working
* This application requires Mist accounts or API token to be used.
* This application is automatically retrieving the account information and access rights from the Mist Cloud.
* When an operator selects a site, the application is retrieving the list of switches and VCs.
* When an operator selects a switch, the application is retrieving the configured networks/vlans from the Mist Cloud.
* When an operator changes a switch port configuration, the application is creating (or updating) a new "Port Profile" at the switch level with the required configuration, and apply to the switch port. All the port profiles managed by the application are name `autogenerated_<port_id>`.
* There is no information stored on the server side, and all the required information are cached on the web browser side (this means everything will be lost if the page is manually refreshed, or when using the web browser "back" button).


## Installation

This is a demo application using the Mist APIs.

You can run it as a strandalone Python application, or deploy it as a Docker container.

**Note**: The application is not providing secured HTTPS connections. It is highly recommended to deploy it behind a reverse proxy providing HTTPS encryption.

### Standalone deployment
1. download the github repository
2. from the project folder, install the python dependencies (ex: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`)
3. from the `django_app`folder, start the app with `python3 ./manage.py runserver` (please see Djano server options with `python3 ./manage.py runserver -h`)

### Docker Image
The docker image is available on docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tmunzer/mist_switch_operator_web_ui.


The Docket image is listening on port TCP8000

## Configuration
You can configure the settings through a configuration file or through Environment Variables.
